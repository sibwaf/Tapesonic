***THIS PROJECT IS IN IT'S EARLY PROTOTYPING/PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STAGE AND IS NOT READY FOR USE***

A Subsonic-compatible music streaming server initially designed for playing Youtube mixtapes through your favorite Subsonic client.

Planned features:
* Better UI/UX
* YouTube channel subscriptions
* YouTube streams as radio
* Album support
* No-download streaming
* YouTube/Bandcamp search
* Listenbrainz-backed recommendation playlists (probably with more provider options like last.fm)
* Lidarr integration - "wanted album" auto-download, media hand-off

Out of scope:
* Handling user-provided libraries
